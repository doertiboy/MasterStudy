This repo was used for a master thesis at the MCI, investigating potential differences between female and male climbers. A study was conducted and the repo includes the data analysis and results. All data used is anonymized. <br>
<br>
In order to implement the data analysis, 3 main files have been used:
* 01_Acceleration: extracts the acceleration, implements gravity compensation and computes the jerk
* 02_FeatureExtraction: extracts features used for machine learning and normalizes it
* 03_Clustering: uses k-means clustering to identify distinct patterns
<br>
Analyzed data is saved in several excel files and the files Plotting and Scattering are used for visualization.
